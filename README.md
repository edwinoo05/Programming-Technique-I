# SECJ 1013 Programming-Technique-I ðŸ’»ðŸ’»

Learning C++ has been a rewarding and demanding experience that has greatly enhanced my development as a programmer. From the outset, my ability to solve problems improved as I worked on creating pseudocode and flowcharts. I was introduced to the fundamentals of C++ syntax, including variables, loops, and conditional logic. As I advanced, I delved into more sophisticated topics like object-oriented programming (OOP). Each concept posed its own set of challenges, but overcoming them brought a deep sense of achievement. Along the way, I faced hurdles such as mastering intricate syntax and debugging runtime issues. Yet, these challenges motivated me to independently seek solutions, collaborate with peers, and enhance my problem-solving skills. In summary, learning C++ has been a transformative journey that has not only provided me with technical expertise but also strengthened my discipline, logical reasoning, and love for coding. I am eager to expand on this foundation and apply C++ to take on more intricate and exciting projects in the future.
